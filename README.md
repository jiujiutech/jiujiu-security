**Project instruction** 
- A set of permission systems developed using SpringBoot, MyBatis, and Shiro frameworks, with a very low threshold and ready to use. At the beginning of the design, we paid great attention to security and escorted the enterprise system, making everything so simple.
- Provide a code generator, just write about 30% of the code, the rest of the code is automatically generated by the system, and the development task can be completed quickly.
- Support for mainstream databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL
<br>

**Features**
- Flexible access control, which can be controlled to pages or buttons to meet most of the permission requirements
- Complete department management and data permissions, control of data permissions through annotations
- Complete XSS prevention and script filtering to completely eliminate XSS attacks
- Support distributed deployment, session storage in redis
- Friendly code structure and comments for easy reading and secondary development
- Introduce quartz timing tasks to dynamically add, modify, delete, pause, resume, and log views
- Page interaction using Vue2.x, greatly improving development efficiency
- Introduced swagger document support for easy writing API interface documentation

<br>

**Data permission design ideas**
- Administrator management, role management, department management, operation of this department and sub-department data
- Menu management, scheduled tasks, parameter management, dictionary management, system logs, no data permissions
- Business function, query and operate data according to user data permission [no data permission of this department, can also query personal data]

 **Software Requirements** 
- JDK1.8 +
- MySQL5.5+
- Maven3.0+

<br>

 **Local deployment**
- Download source code via git
- idea、eclipse need to install the lombok plugin, otherwise you will be prompted to find the get set method of the entity
- Create the database jiujiu_security, the database code is UTF-8MB4
- Execute db/mysql.sql file, initialize data [import table structure and data as needed]
- Modify the application-dev.yml file to update the MySQL account and password
- In the jiujiu-security directory, execute mvn clean install
<br>

- Eclipse, IDEA running AdminApplication.java, you can start the project [jiujiu-admin]
- jiujiu-admin access path: http://localhost:8080/jiujiu-admin
- swagger document path: http://localhost:8080/jiujiu-admin/swagger/index.html
- swagger annotation path: http://localhost:8080/jiujiu-admin/swagger-ui.html
- Account password: admin/admin

<br>

- Eclipse, IDEA running ApiApplication.java, you can start the project [jiujiu-api]
- jiujiu-api access path: http://localhost:8081/jiujiu-api/swagger-ui.html

<br>

- Eclipse, IDEA run GeneratorApplication.java, you can start the project [jiujiu-generator]
- jiujiu-generator access path: http://localhost:8082/jiujiu-generator


<br>

  **Cluster deployment**
- Cluster deployment, you need to install redis and configure redis information.
- Need to configure [jiujiu.redis.open=true] to enable redis cache
- Need to configure [jiujiu.cluster=true] to open the cluster environment
